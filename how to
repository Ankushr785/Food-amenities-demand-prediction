#how to add an extra parameter

1. Go to line 157

2. Inside the curly ({}) bracket add an extra element (separated by comma) in the format - 'label':<list of new feature>

3. list of new feature = spe_data.<new_feature>

4. If your new feature is some form of price, then before the above steps, do the following:
   a. Below line 125, add another line (with the same indent)
   b. Clean the new feature in the same as the AvgSP has been cleaned
   c. continue

5. Copy everything after the (output_variable = output_variable.drop(labels = ['Date'], axis=1)) line and before (#Predicting Customer Count)
   line and paste it again right before the (#Predicting CustomerCount) line
   
6. Change all the abbreviations as per the new feature name, ALL THE ABBREVIATIONS

7. Add predictions_<new feature abbreviation> to the forecasted_iv dataframe (line 343) in the same way as step 2 was carried out.

8. Increase the 'input_dim' parameter in the demand_model function by 1.

9. Copy lines from 394 to 401 to create the new variable forecast and change ALL ABBREVIATIONS.

10. Add the new feature forecast to further_forecast_iv dataframe.

11. Bingo! New Feature added! To delete a feature, reverse this algorithm.
